TrackSub is a full-stack website where users can store their subscriptions of different apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc, with easier functionalities.

📦 Tech Stack: React js, Tailwind CSS, MONGO DB, Express js, Nodejs, React icons.

👨‍🍳 Features: TrackSub users are required to login first with user authentication  to access this website. While registering the new user account it takes time because backend is hosted in Render. It uses MongoDB as a database where the details of Subscription Apps are stored. In the dashboard, there are the details of Apps with great UI. User can click on the Add Subscription button to move to the Streaming App page and can select their used app. The details like Account Number, Amount and End date of the subscription. After the subscription is added then it shows the notification bar where it notifies the added Apps. Users can delete the App when the subscription is finished. 

💭 Process: First I started with brainstorming the functionalities as I was learning the basics of MERN. So, I came up with the idea of building this website where it covers all the basic parts of MERN. As a beginner, I got stuck on the Authentication Process of users with the help of documentation, YouTube and Chatgpt I fixed that and moved ahead. Frontend Part was not that challenging at first but when making a table for the details of the Apps I found it a bit hard to make Responsive as time goes I got the hang of it and other parts were good to go. I found it mostly challenging on Backend parts of course it's my first time doing it. I learned to create schemas and connecting with the routes. 

✨ Improvement: This website is not good in mobile responsive, I tried to fix it but its not that good. I want to show the statistics of the added apps in a Piechart comparing its amount and Dark and Light mode features will also make the website good. 

🚦 Running the Project:
